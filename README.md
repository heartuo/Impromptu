Impromptu
==========
#### A Lightweight 2-D Android Game Development Framework ####

About
------

Impromptu is a hobby project I have been developing throughout the year 2014 without version control. It is partly based on and improved from Mario Zechner's project [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.git), and inspired by his book [Beginning Android Games](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-Games-Mario-Zechner/dp/1430246774). 

Currently the game framework features: 

* Simple built-in GUI
* Easy spriting
* 2-D camera and scroll
* Tiled map and character representation and related pathfinding algorithm 
* Based on OpenGL 1.0
* Loading text, audio, and bitmap files as assets 
* Handlers for user input through button, touchscreen, and accelerometer
* More to be added! 

*TODOs*:

* Add animation system
* Add dialogue system
* Add more demos

Compilation
------

You can compile and run the project to see some tests/demos of the framework. Use Eclipse for Java Developers to import the project, and run as Android application, on either a virtual device, or a real Android device (I used Nexus 7 2013 version). Tablets maybe better. 

Usage
------

A documentation for the project is to be added. For now, have fun playing with the demos!
